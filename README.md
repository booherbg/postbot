postbot
=======

My fork of postbot, an android app for posting to wordpress. I'm adding features that I need for my own purposes.

What is really neat is that this git repo has the original project's svn repo (on google code) as upstream, so I can still pull down updates.

If you wish to work against the postbot project, use this git project as a starting point. I'll rebase the svn repo into this project.
